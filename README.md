# Todo App - Frontend Mentor

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My challenge was to build out this todo app provided by [Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
